# ‚úÖ Condition Builder Completion Plan

## üß† User's Question
> Before we start with AI, would it be wise to test what has been done so far?
> For example, we have successfully created ChooseBlock.  
> Now the steps remaining here before we actually test it are:
>
> 1. Ensure proper details on the PreviewBlock
> 2. When user clicks Submit, how does all user creation get translated to a JSON or any other format ready for submission
>
> After testing this much then we have space for:
> 1. Exhaust the dropdown list
> 2. Create nested blocks for +Group
> 3. Add AI where possible
>
> This sums up the Condition Builder.
> How do we process?

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Finalize & Test Current Condition Builder

### üß© Step 1: Fix PreviewBlock Content
- Pull correct `keyword`, `contextParams`, and `label`
- Format:
  ```
  Indicator: EMA
  Params: period = 9, candle = 15min
  ```

‚û°Ô∏è Update `ChooseBlock` to build and pass this to `PreviewBlock`.

### üß© Step 2: Submit ‚Üí Generate Final JSON
On clicking Submit, return this structure:
```json
{
  "type": "AND",
  "conditions": [
    { "indicator": "EMA", "period": 9, "candle": "15min" },
    { "indicator": "RSI", "value": 30, "operator": "<" }
  ]
}
```
‚û°Ô∏è Write transformer function: `chooseBlocksToConditionGroup()`
